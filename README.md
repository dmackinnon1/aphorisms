# zenaphorisms
A latex document with aphorisms from "Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind" by Shunryu Suzuki.

Each essay in the book "Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind" begins with an aphoristic statement. The typesetting of those statements
looked nice, so this document tries to recreate that using LaTeX.

This LaTeX doc is an opportunity to play around with a few LaTeX packages to try and reproduce the typography there.

Uses `extarticle` and `lettrine`.

I also frequently use this project to test out Overleaf Git and GitHub issues. So a lot of the changes are spurious, like this one.

Update on Overleaf.

Let's see what it looks like from another collaborator.

And changes coming in from multiple collaborators. Like in this case, where I'm editing from two different accounts. It seems that if multiple changes are made, then the last collaborator wins.Let's see if that's true.
