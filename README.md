# zenaphorisms
A latex document with aphorisms from "Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind" by Shunryu Suzuki.

Each essay in the book "Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind" begins with an aphoristic statement. The typesetting of those statements
looked nice, so this document tries to recreate that using LaTeX.

This LaTeX doc is an opportunity to play around with a few LaTeX packages to try and reproduce the typography there.
